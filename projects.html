          This website was made entirely by code! No website builder was used and all designs and layouts were made by me. 
          This website is constantly under change as I try to incorporate more 
          sub-projects into it. If there is something you'd like to see on my website
          such as a new feature or improvement, you can let me know on my contact page, or you can check out the code I used to make this website using the button below!

          I made a maze game using <a class = "processing" target = "_blank" href = "https://processing.org/" > Processing</a>, which utilizes Java to 
          help users create games, animations, and more. I became interested in Processing due to its versatility
          and its ability to help beginner programmers or young programmers learn basic coding concepts while
          enjoying the process! <a class = "ktbyte" target = "_blank" href = "https://ktbyte.com/">KTBYTE</a>, the company I currently instruct at, uses Processing to help young students
          learn Java and programming while visually seeing the applications of their code. See the demo on the left!

      <p>I used Java to create an online shopping simulator which incorporates a credit card algorithm
        to verify valid credit card information upon payment. The project also includes file I/O handling which 
        stores the name of the customer, their address, and credit card information in a .txt file. A demo of the 
        project is to the left of this caption box.

          This is a simple program that follows a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style
          game in which the user can make decisions during the program/story to affect
          the output of the program based on the decisions they choose. A demo of the project
          is shown to the left of this caption box.
